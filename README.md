# Fraud-detection---Health-care-Insurance
R to find fraudulent health care insurance claims

Fraudulent health care insurance claims have significant costs to both health insurance providers as well as consumers. In order to mitigate these costs, we sought to create a model that would help us accurately identify fraudulent claims as well as identify patterns in these claims that would allow us to detect and prevent future fraud. We hypothesized that we could use a K-Nearest Neighbor Model for fraud detection by identifying the circumstances under which providers would be more likely to file fraudulent claims.

Using this model, I found that three factors were most important in determining whether or not there was fraud occurring.
